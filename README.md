Trial registries have evolved into an essential component of the global biomedical research infrastructure, allowing numerous stakeholders to monitor registered studies on a variety of levels. Therefore, maintaining clinical trial transparency is crucial.

b) Data analysis scripts written in Python.

To filter the data and providing the desired results, shell scripting and MS-Excel functions were used.
